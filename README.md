# 🧠 Brain Tumour Detection Using Deep Learning

This project is a **Deep Learning–based Brain Tumour Detection system** that predicts the presence of a brain tumour from **MRI images**.  
The project also includes a **Flask web application with an HTML-based user interface** for easy interaction and prediction.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview
- Brain tumour detection from MRI images
- Deep Learning (CNN)–based image classification
- Flask backend for model inference
- HTML-based frontend for user interaction
- End-to-end project: data → training → web deployment

---

## 🧠 Deep Learning Approach
- Image preprocessing and normalization
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture
- Model trained on MRI brain scan images
- Trained model saved and loaded for predictions

---

## 🌐 Web Application (Flask + HTML)
- Flask used as backend framework
- HTML used to design the user interface
- Users can upload MRI images through the web UI
- The model predicts whether the MRI image shows a brain tumour

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/prashant162004/Brain-Tumour-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning.git
cd Brain-Tumour-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning

Step 2: Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Run the Flask Application
python app.py

The application predicts whether the uploaded MRI image contains a brain tumour

Displays prediction result on the web interface

🔮 Future Enhancements
